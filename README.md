# Project-0-Tic-Tac-Toe

## What has been done:
* Scoreboard updated depending on the number of each players.
* Rolling text displaying the winner of three games.
* Delay applied to each end of games.
* I only used jQuery library. 

## What could be done in more according to my skills:
* At the moment, AI even random is not setup.
* Setup "vs player" and "vs computer" options.

## The main struggles:
* Linking the differents functions such as : rules, winner was a bit difficult and finally easy at the end.
* I spent a lot of time to find the lack of "&& $aText !== """ was the problem of my rules function. Indeed 3 empty strings in the row were considered also as victory.
* I was not sure if an array representation of the boardgame or a simple class attribution from the HTML was the best option. The second method did not lead to many issues.
* I enjoyed searching for animations in css. It's still confusing yet it works.I used this tutorial (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17864907/jquery-move-text-like-movie-credits) to guide me.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuVgb1x0eQQ was helpful to confirm it was possible to start with a HTML table. By starting from scratch, it was better to know in which direction I had to go.
* Cancelling the rolling text animation by clicking on the "New Game" button was hard to understand (var gameReset in victory()).
